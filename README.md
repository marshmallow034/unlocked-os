# Freedom for everyone.
Unlocked OS is an operating system that is powered by the web. Using any web browser you can run this operating system in fullscreen mode to emulate an OS like feeling. The other thing is, is that you can easily put this on anything, you just need a web browser. Go to the website its being hosted on and wallaa... you have a minimal operating system in your web browser. You have full freedom to fork and edit the original code and turn it into anything you want.

# How do I try this out?
There are multiple ways like cloning this repo. But the easiest way for testers is to visit the following website.

https://cfxnet.com/projects/uos/uos.html

# What programs are included?
By default, unlocked OS uses webapps. In fact since there is almost a website for anything in the world, and the web browser is one of our most used programs on our computer, they will become quite handy.

# I found an issue. What do?
Report it on github ;)

# I can't find any issues. What do?
Good. Nothing is broken! \o/

# What are some good ways to implement this operating system onto a device?
You can create a Linux based operating system (or your own, if thats the case) or use a prebuilt one like arch. Just install a Window Manager (DE's are not recommended as they are heavy), and make the WM start up a browser and load Unlocked OS (I recommend you run as HTML file instead of website). Put it on a laptop like a chromebook to do even more.

- We are making a offical distro for Unlocked-OS! It will be out soon!


# Is it free?
Yep. Free as in Freedom and Beer!

# I'm interested!
Sweet! Go to the website "https://cfxnet.com/projects/uos/uos.html" and you will be able to try it for yourself. Or of course, clone the repository and just use the HTML file, that works too.

DISCLAIMER : 

To run some programs in this Operating System correctly you will need to run this in Google Chrome with

X-Frame Assassin    Plugin
iFrame Allow        Plugin
Redirect Everywhere Plugin
---------------------------------
Some applications in this JS Operating System will NOT work unless your running our Linux distro.

the Linux Distro is still a WIP. It will run chrome in Kiosk mode with this code as the desktop enviorment and will be based on Ubuntu 16.04LTS. the applications :

KeyTerminal
KeyFiles

and maybe more in the future will only work on 'UnlockedOS' distro with Desktop Env.
